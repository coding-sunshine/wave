# Livewire Component System for Fusion CRM v4

## Context
Fusion CRM v4 uses Livewire as a core part of the TALL stack to create dynamic, responsive UI components. We need to establish a standardized approach to Livewire component development that follows our architectural patterns.

## Task
Implement a base Livewire component structure that:

1. Establishes conventions for all CRM components
2. Integrates with our tenant awareness system
3. Supports Alpine.js for enhanced interactivity
4. Implements proper validation and error handling

## Technical Requirements
- PHP 8.4 with strict typing (`declare(strict_types=1);`)
- PSR-12 coding standards
- Follow SOLID principles
- Proper class and method documentation
- Integration with Tailwind CSS
- Tenant context awareness

## Implementation Details
- Create a base abstract Livewire component class
- Implement tenant context middleware
- Define standards for component properties and methods
- Establish conventions for component testing
- Create reusable UI patterns following project standards
- Develop helper traits for common functionality

## Expected Output
- Base Livewire component class with tenant awareness
- Common Livewire component traits
- Standard patterns for form handling
- Conventions for UI state management
- Test examples for Livewire components
- Documentation for component development
