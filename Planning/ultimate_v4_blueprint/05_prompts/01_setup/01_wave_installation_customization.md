# Wave Foundation Analysis & CRM Extension Planning

## Context
I have an existing Wave-based Laravel application that serves as the foundation for Fusion CRM V4. Wave provides comprehensive SaaS functionality including user authentication, team management, billing, admin panel, and more. I need to analyze the current Wave implementation and plan how to extend it with CRM-specific functionality.

## Task
Help me analyze the existing Wave foundation and plan CRM extensions. This includes:

1. **Analyzing Current Wave Implementation**
   - Review existing Wave models (User, Team, Plan, Post, Page, Form, etc.)
   - Understand Wave's Filament admin panel structure and existing resources
   - Document Wave's authentication and permission system
   - Analyze Wave's team structure for CRM multi-tenancy adaptation

2. **Planning CRM Model Extensions**
   - Design Property, Lead, Deal, Activity models that integrate with Wave's team structure
   - Plan how to extend Wave's User model for CRM contacts
   - Design database migrations that extend Wave's existing schema
   - Plan CRM-specific permissions that build on Spatie system

3. **Planning Filament Resource Extensions**
   - Design CRM resources that follow Wave's existing resource patterns
   - Plan integration with Wave's existing admin navigation
   - Ensure CRM resources maintain Wave's UI/UX consistency
   - Plan dashboard widgets that extend Wave's existing dashboard

## Wave Integration Points
- **Existing Wave Models**: User, Team, Plan, Post, Page, Form, Category, Permission, Role
- **Existing Wave Resources**: UserResource, RoleResource, PermissionResource, PostResource, PageResource, etc.
- **Wave's Team Structure**: Use for CRM organization/brokerage multi-tenancy
- **Wave's Media System**: Leverage for property photos and documents
- **Wave's Form Builder**: Extend for lead capture forms
- **Wave's Authentication**: Build upon existing JWT and social auth
- **Wave's Theme System**: Extend for CRM-specific layouts

**Current App Model Extensions:**
- `app/Models/User.php` extends `Wave\User` with username generation and role assignment
- `app/Models/Post.php` extends `Wave\Post`
- `app/Models/Category.php` extends `Wave\Category`
- `app/Models/Forms.php` extends `Wave\Form`

**Current Filament Resources (10 total):**
- UserResource, RoleResource, PermissionResource
- PostResource, PageResource, CategoryResource
- PlanResource, SettingResource, FormsResource
- ChangelogResource

**Wave Configuration:**
- User model: `\App\Models\User::class`
- Default role: `registered`
- Billing provider: `stripe`
- Primary color: `#000000`

## Technical Requirements
- **Maintain Wave Compatibility**: All extensions must preserve existing Wave functionality
- **Follow Wave Patterns**: Use established Wave/Filament resource and service patterns
- **PHP 8.1+**: Compatible with current Wave requirements
- **Laravel 11**: Current Wave framework version
- **Filament 3.2**: Current Wave admin panel version
- **PSR-12 Standards**: Follow Wave's existing coding standards

## Expected Output
- **Wave Foundation Analysis**: Comprehensive documentation of current Wave components
- **CRM Extension Plan**: Detailed plan for extending Wave with CRM functionality
- **Model Design**: CRM models that integrate seamlessly with Wave's architecture
- **Resource Plan**: Filament resources that follow Wave's established patterns
- **Migration Strategy**: Database changes that extend Wave's existing schema
- **Integration Roadmap**: Step-by-step plan for Wave-to-CRM transformation

## Success Criteria
- Complete understanding of Wave's existing architecture and capabilities
- Clear plan for CRM extensions that feel native to Wave
- Database design that extends Wave's schema without breaking existing functionality
- Resource designs that maintain Wave's admin panel consistency
- Development strategy that leverages Wave's proven patterns and infrastructure
