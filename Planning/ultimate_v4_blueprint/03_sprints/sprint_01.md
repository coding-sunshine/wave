## üß© Cursor IDE-Ready Prompts (MCPs)

### MCP 1.1: Extend Wave User Model for CRM
```
I need to extend the existing Wave User model to support CRM functionality. Please help me:

1. Analyze the current Wave User model in app/Models/User.php and identify:
   - Existing fields and relationships
   - Current traits and interfaces
   - Authentication and team relationships

2. Add CRM-specific fields to the users table migration:
   - phone (string, nullable)
   - address (text, nullable)
   - license_number (string, nullable)
   - contact_preference (enum: email, phone, sms)
   - crm_settings (json, nullable)
   - lead_source (string, nullable)
   - status (enum: active, inactive, prospect)

3. Extend the User model with CRM relationships:
   - hasMany leads (as assigned agent)
   - hasMany properties (as listing agent)
   - hasMany deals (as agent)
   - hasMany activities (as user)

4. Add CRM-specific methods:
   - getFullAddressAttribute()
   - getPreferredContactMethodAttribute()
   - scopeAgents()
   - scopeClients()

Ensure all changes maintain compatibility with existing Wave functionality and follow Wave's coding patterns.
```

### MCP 1.2: Create Property Model with Wave Patterns
```
Create a Property model that integrates seamlessly with the Wave foundation. The model should:

1. Follow Wave's model structure and conventions:
   - Use Wave's base model patterns
   - Implement proper relationships
   - Include appropriate traits (SoftDeletes, HasFactory)
   - Use Wave's team structure for multi-tenancy

2. Include these fields:
   - team_id (foreign key to Wave's teams table)
   - title, description, price, address
   - property_type (enum: house, apartment, commercial, land)
   - status (enum: available, under_contract, sold, withdrawn)
   - listed_by (foreign key to users table)
   - features (json for property features)
   - coordinates (latitude, longitude)
   - created_at, updated_at, deleted_at

3. Define relationships:
   - belongsTo Team (using Wave's team model)
   - belongsTo User (listing agent)
   - hasMany Leads (interested leads)
   - hasMany Deals (related deals)
   - hasMany Activities (property activities)
   - morphMany Media (using Wave's media system)

4. Include scopes and methods:
   - scopeAvailable()
   - scopeByType()
   - scopeInPriceRange()
   - getFormattedPriceAttribute()
   - getFullAddressAttribute()

5. Create the corresponding migration file that:
   - Uses Wave's migration patterns
   - Includes proper indexes
   - Sets up foreign key constraints
   - Follows Wave's naming conventions

Ensure the model integrates with Wave's existing team structure for proper multi-tenancy.
```

### MCP 1.3: Create Lead Model with Team Integration
```
Create a Lead model that leverages Wave's team structure for multi-tenancy. The model should:

1. Follow Wave's model patterns and include:
   - team_id (foreign key to Wave's teams table)
   - name, email, phone, address
   - source (enum: website, referral, cold_call, social_media, advertisement)
   - status (enum: new, contacted, qualified, unqualified, converted)
   - assigned_to (foreign key to users table)
   - score (integer, 0-100)
   - notes (text)
   - contact_preference (enum: email, phone, sms)
   - last_contacted_at (timestamp)

2. Define relationships following Wave patterns:
   - belongsTo Team (Wave's team model)
   - belongsTo User (assigned agent)
   - hasMany Activities (lead activities)
   - belongsToMany Properties (interested properties)
   - hasOne Deal (if converted)

3. Include scopes and methods:
   - scopeByStatus()
   - scopeBySource()
   - scopeAssignedTo()
   - scopeHighScore()
   - getScoreColorAttribute()
   - getTimeSinceContactAttribute()
   - markAsContacted()

4. Create migration with:
   - Proper foreign key constraints to Wave tables
   - Indexes for performance
   - Wave's timestamp patterns

5. Add model factory for testing that:
   - Uses Wave's existing User and Team factories
   - Creates realistic lead data
   - Follows Wave's factory patterns

Ensure the model works seamlessly with Wave's existing team-based multi-tenancy.
```

### MCP 3.2: Create PropertyResource Following Wave Patterns
```
Create a PropertyResource for Filament that follows the patterns established by Wave's existing resources. The resource should:

1. Analyze Wave's existing resources (UserResource, RoleResource, etc.) and follow their patterns for:
   - Form field organization and validation
   - Table column configuration
   - Action implementations
   - Navigation integration

2. Create PropertyResource with these features:
   - Form with sections for basic info, location, features, and media
   - File upload integration using Wave's media system
   - Proper validation following Wave's patterns
   - Relationship management for team and user associations

3. Include table configuration with:
   - Sortable and searchable columns
   - Filters for property type, status, and price range
   - Bulk actions following Wave's patterns
   - Custom actions for property management

4. Add resource pages:
   - ListProperties page with advanced filtering
   - CreateProperty page with step-by-step form
   - EditProperty page with media management
   - ViewProperty page with detailed information

5. Integrate with Wave's navigation:
   - Add to appropriate navigation group
