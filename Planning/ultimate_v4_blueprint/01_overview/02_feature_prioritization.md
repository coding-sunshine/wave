## Implementation Approach

The implementation strategy follows these principles:

1. **Build foundation first**: Focus on core architecture, authentication, and data structure
2. **Prioritize high-value features**: Implement red-labeled (ğŸ”´) features before others
3. **Group related functionality**: Develop related features together for efficiency
4. **Consider dependencies**: Ensure prerequisite features are built first
5. **Validate early and often**: Test core functionality with real users when possible
6. **Defer complexity**: Push more complex, experimental features to later phases

This phased approach ensures that the most critical functionality is delivered early, while more advanced features build upon a stable foundation.
