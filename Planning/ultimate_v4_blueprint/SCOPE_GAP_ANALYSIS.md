4. **Team Extension**: Adapt Wave teams for CRM organizations

### Phase 2 Prerequisites (Depends on Phase 1)
1. **AI Integration Foundation**: OpenAI service setup
2. **Communication System**: Email/SMS integration
3. **Media Management**: Property photos and documents
4. **Basic Automation**: Task and follow-up systems

1. **Advanced AI Features**: Lead scoring, content generation
2. **Third-party Integrations**: Xero, REA, Domain
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Reporting and business intelligence
4. **Voice Integration**: Vapi.ai and Resemble.ai

## Recommended Build Order

### Sprint 1-2: CRM Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

- Build basic Filament resources
- Extend Wave User model for CRM
- Set up basic relationships

### Sprint 3-4: Basic CRM Operations (Weeks 5-8)
- Implement CRUD operations for all entities
- Build basic pipeline management
- Create activity tracking system
- Implement team-based data isolation

### Sprint 5-6: AI Integration Foundation (Weeks 9-12)
- Install and configure OpenAI integration
- Build basic AI content generation
- Implement lead scoring foundation
- Create automation framework

### Sprint 7-12: Advanced Features (Weeks 13-24)
