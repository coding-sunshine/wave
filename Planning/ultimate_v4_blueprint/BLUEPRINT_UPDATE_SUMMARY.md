## Conclusion

The blueprint updates provide a realistic, actionable roadmap for transforming the current Wave-based foundation into the complete Fusion CRM V4 platform. The corrected analysis shows that while the Wave foundation provides excellent infrastructure (saving significant development time), the vast majority of CRM functionality needs to be built from scratch.

The updated documents now serve as an accurate guide for:
- Understanding the true scope of development required
- Planning realistic timelines and resource allocation
- Identifying critical dependencies and build order
- Managing risks and ensuring project success

This comprehensive update ensures the blueprint serves as a practical, actionable roadmap for delivering the complete Fusion CRM V4 platform as specified in the original requirements.
