# Fusion CRM V4 - Architecture Documentation

This directory contains the comprehensive architectural documentation for Fusion CRM V4, built upon the existing **Wave Kit foundation**. The documents follow a logical sequence from extending Wave's foundation to implementing advanced CRM features, providing step-by-step guidance for transforming the existing Wave application into a comprehensive real estate CRM.

## Current Wave Foundation

The architecture builds upon an existing Wave-based Laravel application with:

### âœ… Already Implemented via Wave
- **Laravel 11** with PHP 8.1+ support and modern architecture
- **Filament 3.2** admin panel with comprehensive resources (User, Role, Permission, Post, Page, etc.)
- **Livewire 3** reactive components and established patterns
- **Alpine.js 3.4.2** frontend interactivity
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4.3** with dynamic theme system (Anchor, Drift themes)
- **Multi-tenant Foundation** via Wave's team structure
- **Authentication System** with JWT, social providers, and 2FA
- **Spatie Permissions** fully configured with role management
- **Stripe Integration** for billing and subscriptions
- **Form Builder** with dynamic fields and entries
- **Media Management** with file uploads and avatars
- **API Foundation** with JWT authentication and basic endpoints

## Document Organization

The architecture documentation is organized to guide **extension of the existing Wave foundation**:

1. **01_system_architecture.md** - How to extend Wave's architecture for CRM needs
2. **02_database_schema.md** - CRM-specific models and relationships building on Wave
3. **03_multi_tenancy.md** - Adapting Wave's team structure for CRM multi-tenancy
4. **04_authentication_authorization.md** - Extending Wave's auth with CRM-specific roles
5. **05_core_crm_features.md** - Building CRM functionality on Wave foundation
6. **06_ai_integration.md** - Adding AI capabilities to the Wave-based system
7. **07_push_portal_technology.md** - Multi-channel property publishing system
8. **08_role_permission_system.md** - Extending Wave's existing permission system
9. **09_xero_integration.md** - Financial integration building on Wave's structure
10. **10_analytics_reporting.md** - Analytics extending Wave's existing dashboard
11. **11_website_api_integration.md** - API extensions for CRM functionality
12. **12_media_management.md** - Extending Wave's media system for properties
13. **13_automation_workflows.md** - Workflow automation using Wave's queue system
14. **14_onboarding_implementation.md** - CRM onboarding extending Wave's user system
15. **15_wave_kit_integration.md** - Strategic approach for Wave-to-CRM transformation

## Implementation Sequence

The documentation is designed to guide **extension development** in a sequential manner. Each document includes:

- Analysis of existing Wave components to leverage
- CRM-specific extensions and new components needed
- Database schemas extending Wave's existing structure
- Service implementations building upon Wave patterns
- Integration points with existing Wave features
- Implementation strategy divided into phases
- Security considerations building on Wave's foundation
- Code examples following established Wave/Filament patterns

## Wave-to-CRM Transformation Strategy

These documents ensure all Wave features are preserved while adding CRM functionality:

- **Leverage Existing** Wave models, resources, and patterns (marked with âœ…)
- **Extend Current** Wave functionality for CRM needs (marked with ðŸ”„)
- **Add New** CRM-specific features building on Wave foundation (marked with ðŸ†•)

## Usage Guidelines

When extending the Wave foundation for Fusion CRM V4:

1. **Start with Wave analysis** (15_wave_kit_integration.md) to understand current foundation
2. **Follow extension patterns** outlined in foundational documents (01-04)
3. **Build CRM features** (05-14) using established Wave/Filament patterns
4. **Leverage existing resources** rather than rebuilding foundational components
5. **Use provided code examples** as implementation references following Wave conventions
6. **Maintain Wave compatibility** to preserve existing functionality and upgrade path

## Development Principles

- **Extend, Don't Replace**: Build upon Wave's solid foundation rather than recreating
- **Follow Wave Patterns**: Use established Wave/Filament resource and service patterns
- **Maintain Compatibility**: Ensure existing Wave features continue to work
- **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Use Wave's team structure, auth system, and admin panel
- **Build Upon Proven Architecture**: Extend Wave's battle-tested SaaS foundation

This documentation serves as both an architectural blueprint and implementation guide for efficiently transforming the existing Wave-based application into a comprehensive real estate CRM platform.
