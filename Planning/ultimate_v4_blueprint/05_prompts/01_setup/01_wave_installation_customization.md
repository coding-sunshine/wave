# Wave Installation and Initial Customization

## Context
I have installed Wave as the foundation for Fusion CRM v4, and now I need to customize it to align with our application requirements. Wave provides user authentication, billing, and basic team functionality that we'll extend for our CRM.

## Task
Help me customize the Wave installation to prepare it for Fusion CRM v4 development. This includes:

1. Configuring the application name, environment settings, and database connection
2. Customizing the initial Wave migrations to support our multi-tenant architecture
3. Setting up the basic directory structure for our custom Fusion CRM components
4. Preparing the application for PHP 8.4 and enforcing PSR-12 coding standards

## Technical Requirements
- PHP 8.4
- Laravel (latest compatible with Wave)
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards strictly
- Implement strict typing (`declare(strict_types=1);`)
- Configure PHPStan for static analysis

## Expected Output
- Updated configuration files
- Customized initial migrations
- Directory structure for Fusion CRM components
- Configuration for code style and static analysis
