### MCP 1.1: Create Task Model and Migration
```
Create a Task model and migration for Fusion CRM V4 with the following specifications:
1. Generate migration with these fields:
   - id (bigIncrements)
   - tenant_id (foreignId with constraint)
   - title (string)
   - description (text, nullable)
   - task_type (string) - call, email, meeting, other
   - status (string) - not_started, in_progress, completed, deferred
   - priority (string) - low, medium, high, urgent
   - category_id (foreignId, nullable, with constraint)
   - due_date (date, nullable)
   - due_time (time, nullable)
   - start_date (date, nullable)
   - start_time (time, nullable)
   - completed_at (timestamp, nullable)
   - assigned_to (foreignId, nullable, references users)
   - assigned_by (foreignId, references users)
   - related_type (morphs, nullable) - polymorphic relation to clients, properties, etc.
   - is_recurring (boolean, default false)
   - recurrence_pattern (json, nullable)
   - reminder_at (timestamp, nullable)
   - reminder_sent (boolean, default false)
   - created_by (foreignId with constraint)
   - timestamps
   - softDeletes

2. Create Task model with:
   - Tenant scope implementation
   - Relationships to:
     - Tenant (BelongsTo)
     - Category (BelongsTo)
     - AssignedTo (BelongsTo User)
     - AssignedBy (BelongsTo User)
     - Creator (BelongsTo User)
     - Related (MorphTo) - polymorphic relation to clients, properties, etc.
     - Comments (MorphMany)
   - Appropriate accessor methods for due_date_formatted, priority_label, etc.
   - Scope methods for filtering by status, priority, assignment, due date
   - Events for task lifecycle: created, updated, completed, assigned
   - Reminder scheduling logic

3. Set up factories and seeders for testing

Implement using Laravel 12's best practices for model definition, with proper
type hints, docblocks, and tenant isolation logic.
```

### MCP 2.4: Create Calendar Service
```
Create a comprehensive CalendarService for Fusion CRM V4 that manages tasks and events:
1. Define CalendarServiceInterface with methods:
   - getCalendarEvents($startDate, $endDate, $filters = []): Collection
   - createEvent(array $data): Event
   - updateEvent($id, array $data): bool
   - deleteEvent($id): bool
   - getEventById($id): ?Event
   - getRecurringEvents($startDate, $endDate, $filters = []): Collection
   - createRecurringEvent(array $data, array $recurrencePattern): Event
   - updateRecurringEvent($id, array $data, $updateMode = 'single'): bool
   - addEventAttendee($eventId, $userId, $status = 'invited'): bool
   - updateAttendeeStatus($eventId, $userId, $status): bool
   - getTasksForCalendar($startDate, $endDate, $filters = []): Collection
   - exportCalendarEvents($startDate, $endDate, $format = 'ics'): string
   - generateCalendarLink($eventId): string
   - getUpcomingEvents($days = 7, $userId = null): Collection
   - getOverdueEvents($userId = null): Collection

2. Implement CalendarService class that:
   - Injects EventRepository and TaskRepository
   - Implements all interface methods with proper business logic
   - Handles recurring event generation based on patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
   - Manages date calculations and timezone handling
   - Implements proper validation and error handling
   - Maintains proper tenant isolation
   - Uses caching for performance optimization

3. Create recurrence pattern handling that supports:
   - Daily, weekly, monthly, yearly patterns
   - Interval specifications (every X days, weeks, etc.)
   - End conditions (end date, occurrence count, never)
   - Day of week specifications for weekly patterns
   - Day of month specifications for monthly patterns

4. Create ServiceProvider for binding the interface to implementation

Follow Laravel 12 best practices for service implementation with proper
error handling, validation, and clean separation of concerns.
```

1. Implement a Livewire component CalendarViewComponent that:
   - Integrates with FullCalendar.js for UI rendering
   - Supports day, week, month, and list views
   - Handles real-time updates through Livewire events
   - Lazy-loads events as the date range changes
   - Supports event filtering by type, user, and category

2. Implement features:
   - Drag and drop for event rescheduling
   - Event resizing for duration changes
   - Click to create new events
   - Event coloring based on type and status
   - Quick view modal for event details

   - Quick create/edit forms
   - Print view for calendar

4. Add advanced features:
   - Calendar sharing options
   - User availability indication
   - Recurring event pattern display
   - Timezone handling and display

   for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop.

6. Ensure the component maintains tenant isolation and respects user permissions
   for viewing and editing events.

Follow Tailwind and Alpine.js best practices for interactive elements and
ensure the component is optimized for performance with proper event delegation
and minimal repaints.
