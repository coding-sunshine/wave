## V3 to V4 Transition

These documents ensure all V3 features are preserved while adding new V4 functionality:

- Existing V3 functionality is maintained and often enhanced (marked with ðŸ”„)
- New V4 features are clearly identified (marked with ðŸ†•)

## Usage Guidelines

When implementing Fusion CRM V4:

1. Start with the foundational documents (01-04) to establish the core architecture
2. Implement the basic CRM functionality (05) before advanced features
3. Follow the phased implementation strategy in each document
4. Use the provided code examples as implementation references
5. Adhere to the security considerations throughout development

This documentation serves as both an architectural blueprint and implementation guide for creating a robust, feature-rich CRM platform for real estate professionals.
