# API Integration System Implementation

## Context
Fusion CRM v4 requires a robust API system for both consuming external services and providing API access to the CRM data. This system needs to handle authentication, rate limiting, and tenant isolation.

## Task
Implement a comprehensive API integration system that:

1. Creates a unified framework for consuming external APIs
2. Establishes a secure REST API for CRM data access
3. Implements proper authentication and rate limiting
4. Ensures tenant isolation in all API operations
5. Supports white-labeled API endpoints and documentation

## Technical Requirements
- PHP 8.4 with strict typing (`declare(strict_types=1);`)
- PSR-12 coding standards
- Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
- API Resources for response formatting
- Tenant context in all API endpoints
- Comprehensive test coverage with Pest
- White-label capability with tenant-specific API keys and configuration

## Implementation Details
- Create a base ApiService for external API consumption
- Implement specialized API clients for specific services
- Design a robust API authentication system with Sanctum
- Build API resources for standardized responses
- Create proper rate limiting and throttling
- Implement tenant middleware for all API routes
- Add proper error handling and logging for API operations
- Support tenant-specific API keys and secrets storage
- Enable white-labeled API documentation with tenant branding
- Implement tenant-specific property customization in API responses
- Support for private notes and tenant-specific properties in API endpoints

## White-Label API Implementation
- Create a configuration system for tenant-specific API settings
- Implement tenant-specific API keys and credentials management
- Generate white-labeled API documentation with tenant branding
- Support custom domains for API endpoints
- Provide tenant-specific email notifications for API events
- Implement tenant-specific rate limits based on subscription plan

## Property Customization API
- Create endpoints for managing tenant-specific property customizations
- Implement API endpoints for tenant-specific property management
- Add support for private and public property notes
- Enable filtering of properties based on tenant customization settings

## Expected Output
- API routes and controllers for CRM data access
- API authentication with Sanctum
- API resources for all entity types
- Rate limiting and throttling configuration
- External API service clients
- Middleware for tenant context
- Tenant-specific API key management
- White-labeled API documentation system
- Property customization endpoints
- Complete test coverage for all API functionality
