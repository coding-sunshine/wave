## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Assistants (Cursor, etc.)

1. **Always reference Wave foundation**: Each prompt includes context about existing Wave components to leverage
2. **Follow Wave patterns**: Prompts guide you to extend existing Wave patterns rather than create new ones
3. **Maintain compatibility**: All prompts ensure Wave functionality remains intact
4. **Use established infrastructure**: Leverage Wave's team structure, auth system, and admin panel

### For Developers

1. **Start with analysis prompts** (01_setup) to understand current Wave foundation
2. **Follow sequential development** using prompts in order
3. **Customize prompts** based on your specific Wave configuration
4. **Test extensions** using Wave-compatible testing approaches
