# Strategy-Based Funnel Engine Implementation

## Context
As described in the blueprint, the Strategy-Based Funnel Engine is a powerful, modular system that enables Members to launch strategy-specific funnels (e.g., Co-Living, Rooming, Dual Occ) with full AI, automation, and voice agent integration.

## Task
Implement a comprehensive funnel engine that:

1. Creates a template system for different property strategies
2. Integrates landing pages, email sequences, and lead scoring logic
3. Connects with OpenAI for content personalization
4. Integrates with Vapi for lead qualification via voice AI
5. Implements proper routing into the CRM

## Technical Requirements
- PHP 8.4 with strict typing (`declare(strict_types=1);`)
- PSR-12 coding standards
- Follow SOLID principles
- Ensure tenant isolation for funnel data
- Implement proper validation with Form Requests
- Create comprehensive Pest tests

## Implementation Details
- Create a modular funnel template system
- Implement a funnel builder interface
- Design reusable components for different funnel stages
- Create integration with AI services for content generation
- Implement analytics for funnel performance
- Add proper event tracking throughout the funnel

## Expected Output
- Funnel and FunnelTemplate models with migrations
- FunnelStage and FunnelComponent models
- Controllers for funnel management
- Action classes for all funnel operations
- Form Requests for validation
- Livewire components for funnel builder interface
- Integration with email, landing page, and voice systems
- Complete test coverage with Pest tests
