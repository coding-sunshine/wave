   - currency (string, default='USD')
   - expected_close_date (date, nullable)
   - actual_close_date (date, nullable)
   - probability (integer, default=0) - percentage 0-100
   - status (string) - open, won, lost, cancelled
   - source (string, nullable)

     - Tenant (BelongsTo)
     - Pipeline (BelongsTo)
     - Stage (BelongsTo)
     - Client (BelongsTo)
     - Property (BelongsTo, nullable)
     - AssignedTo (BelongsTo User)
     - Creator (BelongsTo User)
     - Activities (MorphMany)
     - Notes (MorphMany)
     - Documents (MorphMany)
     - Products (BelongsToMany with pivot table including quantity, price)
   - Accessor methods for:
     - formatted_amount
     - weighted_amount (amount * probability/100)
     - days_in_pipeline
     - days_in_stage
     - days_to_close (from now to expected_close_date)
     - status_label
   - Scope methods for:
     - byStatus
     - byPipeline
     - byStage
     - byOwner
     - byProbabilityRange
     - byCloseDate
     - openDeals
     - wonDeals
     - lostDeals

3. Configure for activity logging with detailed tracking of stage changes

4. Set up factories and seeders for testing

Implement using Laravel 12's best practices for model definition with proper
type hints, docblocks, and tenant isolation logic.
```

### MCP 2.4: Create Deal Service
```
Create a comprehensive DealService for Fusion CRM V4 that implements the following:
1. Define DealServiceInterface with methods:
   - getAllDeals($filters = [], $perPage = 15): LengthAwarePaginator
   - getDealById($id): ?Deal
   - createDeal(array $data): Deal
   - updateDeal($id, array $data): bool
   - deleteDeal($id): bool
   - restoreDeal($id): bool
   - getDealsByPipeline($pipelineId, $filters = [], $perPage = 15): LengthAwarePaginator
   - getDealsByStage($stageId, $filters = [], $perPage = 15): LengthAwarePaginator
   - getDealsByClient($clientId, $filters = [], $perPage = 15): LengthAwarePaginator
   - getDealsByUser($userId, $filters = [], $perPage = 15): LengthAwarePaginator
   - moveDealToStage($dealId, $stageId, $notes = null): bool
   - updateDealStatus($dealId, $status, $notes = null): bool
   - markDealAsWon($dealId, $closeDate = null, $notes = null): bool
   - markDealAsLost($dealId, $reason = null): bool
   - calculateDealForecast($dealId): array
   - getDealTimeline($dealId): Collection
   - addDealNote($dealId, $note, $userId): bool
   - attachDocument($dealId, $documentId): bool
   - detachDocument($dealId, $documentId): bool

   - getWeightedDealsValue($filters = []): float
   - getDealConversionRate($filters = []): float
   - getAverageDealCycle($filters = []): int
   - getRecentlyModifiedDeals($limit = 5): Collection
   - getDealsSummaryByStage($pipelineId): Collection
   - searchDeals(string $term, $filters = []): Collection

2. Implement DealService class that:
   - Injects DealRepository, PipelineRepository, StageRepository
   - Implements all interface methods with proper business logic
   - Handles pipeline stage transitions with validation
   - Tracks deal history and activity
   - Creates events for deal lifecycle: created, stage_changed, status_changed, won, lost
   - Implements proper tenant isolation
   - Uses transactions where appropriate
