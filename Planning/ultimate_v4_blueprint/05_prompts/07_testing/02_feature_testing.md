# Feature Testing Implementation

## Context
Feature testing is essential for ensuring the reliability and correctness of Fusion CRM v4. Following the project rules, we need to implement comprehensive feature tests using Pest PHP.

## Task
Implement a feature testing strategy that:

1. Creates tests for HTTP endpoints and controllers
2. Tests Livewire component functionality
3. Verifies tenant isolation and security
4. Ensures proper authorization checks

## Technical Requirements
- Pest PHP for all tests
- Feature test organization following project standards
- Proper test database setup with migrations
- Factory pattern for test data generation
- Authentication and tenant context setup for tests

## Implementation Details
- Organize feature tests in `tests/Feature/Http` directory structure
- Create base feature test class with authentication and tenant setup
- Implement helper traits for common testing scenarios
- Set up database transactions for test isolation
- Design factory classes for generating test data
- Create assertion helpers for common validations

## Expected Output
- Feature test setup for all controllers and HTTP endpoints
- Livewire component testing implementation
- Tenant context testing helpers
- Authentication and authorization test helpers
- Example tests for core features
- Coverage reports configuration
