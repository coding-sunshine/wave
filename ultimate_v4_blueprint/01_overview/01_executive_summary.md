## Development Approach

This technical master plan outlines a 25-week development schedule divided into 13 bi-weekly sprints. The approach is specifically tailored for solo development, with:

- **Incremental Development**: Building features in a logical, step-by-step manner
- **MVP-First Approach**: Focusing on critical features first before adding enhancements
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leveraging Cursor IDE with specific AI prompts for efficient coding
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Incorporating testing throughout the development process
- **Buffer Time**: Allowing for research, debugging, and refinement

## Technical Strategy

The system architecture focuses on:

- **Single-Tenant Architecture**: Isolating each organization's data for security and performance
- **Service-Based Design**: Implementing clean, modular services for business logic
- **Repository Pattern**: Using repositories for data access where appropriate
- **Queue-Based Processing**: Offloading intensive tasks to background queues
- **Caching Strategies**: Implementing smart caching for performance optimization
- **Comprehensive API**: Building a well-documented, versioned API

## Priority Features
