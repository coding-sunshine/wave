## üß© Cursor IDE-Ready Prompts (MCPs)

### MCP 1.1: Create New Laravel 12 Project
```
Create a new Laravel 12 project for Fusion CRM V4 with the following structure:
1. Set up standard Laravel 12 application
2. Configure .env structure for multi-environment support (local, testing, staging, production)
3. Update composer.json with required dependencies:
   - PHP 8.2+
   - Laravel Framework 12.x
   - Laravel Pint for code styling
   - PHPStan for static analysis
   - Pest PHP for testing
4. Create a README.md with project setup instructions
5. Implement a basic folder structure that supports:
   - Domain-driven design with Services and Models
   - Multi-tenancy support
   - API resources for future endpoints
Focus on performance, scalability, and tenant isolation as core architectural principles.
```

### MCP 2.1: Design Core Entity Relationships
```
Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Fusion CRM V4 with the following core entities:
1. Tenants: Multi-tenant architecture with complete data isolation
2. Users: User accounts with role/permission assignments
3. Clients: Core client entities with contact information and relationships
4. Properties: Real estate properties with detailed attributes
5. Deals/Opportunities: Sales pipeline tracking
6. Tasks/Activities: User task management
7. Documents: Document storage and management
8. Xero Integration: Tables for Xero integration mappings

Include foreign key relationships, indexing strategy, and data type recommendations.
Optimize for:
- Query performance across tenant boundaries
- Scalability for large datasets
- Data integrity with proper constraints

Implement using Laravel migrations with appropriate data types, indexes, and comments.
```

### MCP 3.2: Set Up Model Structure with Scopes
```
Create a robust Eloquent model structure for Fusion CRM V4 that includes:
1. Base model abstract class with:
   - Tenant scope implementation
   - Common accessors and mutators
   - Timestamp handling
   - Soft delete configuration
   - Standard relationship methods
   - Query optimization techniques

2. Model traits for common functionality:
   - HasTenantScope - Automatically applies tenant scope to all queries
   - HasStatusAttribute - For models with status fields
   - HasUserTracking - For tracking created_by and updated_by
   - HasSortableAttributes - For consistent column sorting

3. Implement specific model classes for core entities:
   - Tenant model
   - User model with authentication integration
   - Client model
   - Property model
   
4. Configure Eloquent features:
   - Global scopes for tenant filtering
   - Local scopes for common query patterns
   - Eager loading optimization
   - Attribute casting
   - Hidden/visible attributes for serialization

Focus on creating a model structure that enforces tenant isolation at the database level
while providing rich query capabilities and maintaining clean separation of concerns.
```

### MCP 3.3: Set Up Service Layer Architecture
```
Create a service layer implementation for Fusion CRM V4 that includes:
1. BaseService abstract class with:
   - Authentication context management
   - Tenant context handling
   - Transaction support
   - Error handling and logging
   - Event dispatching

2. Service implementation pattern for core services:
   - Define clear public interfaces with method signatures
   - Implement direct Eloquent model queries
   - Encapsulate business logic
   - Enforce validation and business rules
   - Handle cross-cutting concerns

3. Implement specific service classes:
   - TenantService - Managing tenant operations
   - UserService - User management and authentication
   - ClientService - Client data operations

4. Service provider for binding services to the container

5. Implement dependency injection throughout services

Ensure all services maintain proper separation of concerns while leveraging
Laravel's Eloquent ORM directly for data access. Focus on clean, maintainable
code with proper type hinting and documentation.
