# Enhanced Property Customization Workflows

## Context
Fusion CRM v4 requires sophisticated property customization workflows that enable tenants to efficiently manage and customize property listings at scale. These workflows should support batch operations, templates, approval processes, and version control to ensure consistent and high-quality property customizations.

## Task
Implement comprehensive property customization workflows that:

1. Support batch property customization for managing multiple properties
2. Enable the creation and application of customization templates
3. Facilitate A/B testing for property descriptions and features
4. Allow scheduled and conditional property customizations
5. Implement team-based approval workflows for property changes
6. Provide version history and rollback capabilities
7. Support custom field management per tenant

## Technical Requirements
- PHP 8.4 with strict typing (`declare(strict_types=1);`)
- PSR-12 coding standards
- Laravel framework with tenant awareness
- Workflow state management
- SOLID principles and clean architecture
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- Proper database transaction handling

## Implementation Details

- Support progressive batch processing for large datasets
- Implement validation for batch operations

### Template Management
- Design a template system for reusable customizations
- Support variable placeholders in templates
- Enable template categories and organization
- Provide template versioning and history
- Implement template application logic

### A/B Testing Framework
- Create variant management for property descriptions
- Implement traffic splitting for variant testing
- Design conversion tracking for variant performance
- Build statistical analysis for test results
- Support automated winner selection

### Scheduling and Automation
- Implement a scheduling system for future customizations
- Create conditional logic for trigger-based customizations
- Design workflow automation rules
- Build a queue-based processing system for scheduled tasks
- Support recurring customization schedules

### Approval Workflows
- Design a flexible approval workflow engine
- Support multi-step approval processes
- Implement role-based approvals and permissions
- Create notification system for pending approvals
- Enable comments and feedback during approval process

### Version Control
- Implement property customization versioning
- Support side-by-side version comparison
- Enable selective rollback to previous versions
- Track change history with user attribution
- Build audit logging for compliance

### Custom Fields System
- Design a dynamic field management system
- Support various field types (text, select, number, etc.)
- Implement field validation rules
- Enable field dependencies and conditional visibility
- Support tenant-specific field configurations

## Database Design
The system will utilize these key tables:

1. `property_customization_templates` - Reusable customization templates
2. `property_customization_workflows` - Workflow definitions and states
3. `property_customization_versions` - Version history for customizations
4. `property_customization_approvals` - Approval records and states
5. `property_customization_batches` - Batch operation records
6. `property_customization_ab_tests` - A/B test configurations
7. `property_custom_fields` - Dynamic field definitions

## Models and Relationships
The system will implement these key models:

1. `PropertyCustomizationTemplate` - For reusable templates
2. `PropertyCustomizationWorkflow` - For workflow definitions
3. `PropertyCustomizationVersion` - For version tracking
4. `PropertyCustomizationApproval` - For approval states
5. `PropertyCustomizationBatch` - For batch operations
6. `PropertyCustomizationAbTest` - For A/B testing
7. `PropertyCustomField` - For dynamic fields

## Service Layer
The property customization system will be built with these core services:

1. `BatchCustomizationService` - Manages batch operations
2. `TemplateManagementService` - Handles templates
3. `AbTestingService` - Controls A/B testing
4. `SchedulingService` - Manages scheduled customizations
5. `ApprovalWorkflowService` - Handles approval processes
6. `VersionControlService` - Manages versions and rollbacks
7. `CustomFieldService` - Manages dynamic fields

## Frontend Components
The system will include these Livewire components:

1. `BatchPropertySelector` - For selecting properties for batch operations
2. `TemplateManager` - For creating and managing templates
3. `AbTestDesigner` - For setting up A/B tests
4. `ScheduleCustomizationForm` - For scheduling future changes
5. `ApprovalWorkflowDesigner` - For defining approval workflows
6. `VersionHistoryViewer` - For viewing and comparing versions
7. `CustomFieldManager` - For managing custom fields

## Testing Requirements
- Unit testing for all customization services
- Feature testing for workflow processes
- Integration testing for template application
- Visual regression testing for custom field rendering
- Performance testing for batch operations

## Expected Output
- Complete batch property customization system
- Template management and application functionality
- A/B testing framework for property content
- Scheduling and automation capabilities
- Approval workflow system
- Version history and rollback features
- Custom field management system
- Full documentation and testing coverage

## Best Practices
- Use state machines for workflow management
- Implement proper locking for concurrent customizations
- Design for scalability with large property portfolios
- Create an extensible system for future customization types
- Ensure all operations are fully transactional
- Implement proper validation at all levels
- Provide clear feedback for users throughout workflows
