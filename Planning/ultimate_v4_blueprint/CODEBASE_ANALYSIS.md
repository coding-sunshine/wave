  "devdojo/auth": "^1.0",
  "devdojo/themes": "0.0.11",
  "filament/filament": "^3.2",
  "livewire/livewire": "^3.0",

}
```

**Frontend Stack:**

{
  "alpinejs": "^3.4.2",
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.3",
  "vite": "^6.2"
}
```

### Existing Filament Resources

The admin panel already includes comprehensive resources:

1. **UserResource** - User management with roles/permissions
2. **RoleResource** - Role management with Spatie permissions
3. **PermissionResource** - Permission management
4. **PostResource** - Blog/content management
5. **PageResource** - Static page management
6. **CategoryResource** - Content categorization
7. **PlanResource** - Subscription plan management
8. **SettingResource** - Application settings
9. **FormsResource** - Dynamic form builder
10. **ChangelogResource** - Version/update management

### Current Models Structure

**Wave Models (in `wave/src/`):**
- `User.php` - Extended user with subscriptions, teams, API keys
- `Plan.php` - Subscription plans
- `Subscription.php` - Billing management
- `Post.php` - Content management
- `Page.php` - Static pages
- `Category.php` - Categorization
- `Form.php` - Dynamic forms
- `FormEntry.php` - Form submissions
- `Setting.php` - Configuration
- `Changelog.php` - Version tracking
- `ApiKey.php` - API authentication

**App Models (in `app/Models/`):**
- `User.php` - Extends Wave User with username generation and role assignment
- `Post.php` - Extends Wave Post
- `Category.php` - Extends Wave Category
- `Forms.php` - Extends Wave Form

### Current Wave Configuration

**Wave Config (`config/wave.php`):**
```php
'user_model' => \App\Models\User::class,
'default_user_role' => 'registered',
'primary_color' => '#000000',
'billing_provider' => 'stripe',
'show_docs' => true,
'demo' => false,
'dev_bar' => false
```

**Current User Model Extension Pattern:**
```php
// app/Models/User.php extends Wave\User
class User extends WaveUser
{
    use Notifiable, HasProfileKeyValues;

    // Automatic username generation from name
    // Default role assignment on creation
    // Maintains Wave's subscription and team functionality
}
```

**Existing Filament Admin Panel:**
- 10 fully configured resources following consistent patterns
- Wave-specific widgets and dashboard
- Integrated navigation and permissions
- Theme-aware UI components

## ðŸ”„ CRM Extension Strategy

### 1. Leverage Existing Foundation

**User Management:**
- Extend Wave\User model for CRM contacts
- Use existing role/permission system for CRM roles (Agent, Broker, Admin)
- Leverage team structure for multi-tenant CRM organizations

**Admin Panel:**
- Follow existing Filament resource patterns
- Extend current resources where applicable
- Build new CRM resources (Property, Lead, Deal, etc.)

**Authentication & API:**
- Build upon existing JWT authentication
- Extend API routes for CRM functionality
- Use existing team-based data isolation

### 2. Required CRM Models

**New Models to Create:**
```php
// CRM-specific models
app/Models/Property.php
app/Models/Lead.php
app/Models/Deal.php
app/Models/Contact.php (or extend User)
app/Models/Activity.php
app/Models/Pipeline.php
app/Models/Communication.php
```

**New Filament Resources:**
```php
app/Filament/Resources/PropertyResource.php
app/Filament/Resources/LeadResource.php
app/Filament/Resources/DealResource.php
app/Filament/Resources/ActivityResource.php
app/Filament/Resources/PipelineResource.php
```

### 3. Database Extensions

**Extend Existing Tables:**
- Add CRM fields to `users` table for contact information
- Extend `teams` table for CRM organization data

**New CRM Tables:**
- `properties` - Property listings and details
- `leads` - Lead management and tracking
- `deals` - Transaction and deal management
- `activities` - Task and activity tracking
- `pipelines` - Sales pipeline configuration
- `communications` - Email/SMS/call history

### 4. Theme System Integration

**Current Theme Structure:**
```
resources/themes/
â”œâ”€â”€ anchor/          # Default theme
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layouts/
â””â”€â”€ drift/           # Alternative theme
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
    â”œâ”€â”€ components/
    â””â”€â”€ layouts/
```

**CRM Theme Extensions:**
- Add CRM-specific components to existing themes
- Create CRM dashboard layouts
- Extend existing Livewire components

### 5. Package Additions Needed

**CRM-Specific Packages:**
```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-medialibrary  # Property photos
composer require maatwebsite/excel           # Import/export
composer require barryvdh/laravel-dompdf     # PDF generation
composer require laravel/horizon             # Queue management
composer require openai-php/client           # AI integration
```
