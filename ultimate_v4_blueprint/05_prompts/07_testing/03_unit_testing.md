# Unit Testing Implementation

## Context
Unit testing is critical for ensuring the reliability of individual components in Fusion CRM v4. Following the project rules, we need to implement comprehensive unit tests using Pest PHP for all business logic.

## Task
Implement a unit testing strategy that:

1. Tests individual classes and methods in isolation
2. Verifies the logic of Action classes, Services, and Models
3. Uses mocks and stubs for external dependencies
4. Achieves high code coverage for all business logic

## Technical Requirements
- Pest PHP for all tests
- Unit test organization following project standards
- Proper mocking of dependencies
- Data providers for testing multiple scenarios
- Higher-order Pest expectations for readable assertions

## Implementation Details
- Organize unit tests in `tests/Unit` with subdirectories by component type:
  - `tests/Unit/Actions` for Action classes
  - `tests/Unit/Models` for Eloquent models
  - `tests/Unit/Services` for service classes
- Create mock implementations for external services and dependencies
- Use data providers for testing multiple input variations
- Implement higher-order expectations for concise assertions
- Focus on testing business logic rather than framework features

## Expected Output
- Unit test setup for all Action classes
- Unit tests for Models and their relationships/scopes
- Unit tests for Service classes
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Example tests with data providers
- Documentation on unit testing best practices
