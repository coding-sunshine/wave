## üß© Cursor IDE-Ready Prompts (MCPs)

### MCP 1.1: Analyze Existing Wave Models
```
I have an existing Wave-based Laravel application and need to analyze the current models to understand how to extend them for CRM functionality. Please help me:

1. Review the existing Wave User model in app/Models/User.php and document:
   - Current fields and relationships
   - Authentication features
   - Team relationships
   - API token management

2. Analyze the Wave Team model and understand:
   - How teams are structured
   - User-team relationships
   - How this can be adapted for CRM organizations/brokerages

3. Review other Wave models (Plan, Post, Page, Form, etc.) and identify:
   - Patterns used for model structure
   - Relationship conventions
   - Traits and interfaces used

4. Document the current database schema and identify:
   - Tables that can be extended for CRM
   - Relationship patterns to follow
   - Migration strategies for CRM additions

Focus on understanding the existing architecture so we can extend it properly for CRM functionality.
```

### MCP 1.2: Review Existing Filament Resources
```
I need to analyze the existing Filament resources in my Wave application to understand the patterns for creating CRM-specific resources. Please help me:

1. Review the UserResource in app/Filament/Resources/UserResource.php and document:
   - Form field patterns and validation
   - Table column configurations
   - Action implementations
   - Page structure and navigation

2. Analyze the RoleResource and PermissionResource to understand:
   - How Spatie permissions are integrated
   - Resource relationship handling
   - Admin panel navigation patterns

3. Review other resources (PostResource, PageResource, etc.) and identify:
   - Common patterns across resources
   - Reusable components and widgets
   - Form and table conventions

4. Plan how to create CRM resources (PropertyResource, LeadResource, DealResource) that:
   - Follow established Wave patterns
   - Integrate with existing navigation
   - Maintain consistent UI/UX
   - Leverage existing components

Provide specific examples of how to extend these patterns for CRM entities.
```

### MCP 2.1: Design CRM Model Extensions
```
Based on my analysis of the existing Wave foundation, help me design CRM-specific models that extend the current architecture. I need:

1. Property model that:
   - Extends Wave's model patterns
   - Integrates with Wave's team structure for multi-tenancy
   - Uses Wave's media system for property photos
   - Follows Wave's relationship conventions

2. Lead model that:
   - Connects to Wave's User model for assignment
   - Uses Wave's team structure for organization isolation
   - Integrates with Wave's form system for lead capture
   - Follows Wave's status/workflow patterns

3. Deal model that:
   - Links to Property and Lead models
   - Tracks sales pipeline stages
   - Integrates with Wave's user system for agent assignment
   - Uses Wave's activity/event patterns

4. Activity model that:
   - Tracks interactions across all CRM entities
   - Integrates with Wave's user system
   - Uses Wave's timestamp and tracking patterns

Provide complete model code with:
- Proper relationships following Wave conventions
- Appropriate traits and interfaces
- Database migration files
- Model factories for testing
- Proper tenant scoping using Wave's team structure

Ensure all models integrate seamlessly with the existing Wave architecture.
```

### MCP 2.2: Plan Filament Resource Extensions
```
Help me plan CRM-specific Filament resources that extend the existing Wave admin panel. I need:

1. PropertyResource that:
   - Follows the pattern established by Wave's existing resources
   - Integrates with Wave's media system for photo uploads
   - Uses Wave's form validation patterns
   - Maintains consistent navigation with existing resources

2. LeadResource that:
   - Extends Wave's user management patterns
   - Integrates with the Property model for lead-property relationships
   - Uses Wave's status management patterns
   - Follows Wave's table and form conventions

3. DealResource that:
   - Creates a sales pipeline interface
   - Integrates with both Lead and Property resources
   - Uses Wave's relationship management patterns
   - Implements Kanban-style pipeline views

4. Enhanced dashboard widgets that:
   - Extend Wave's existing dashboard
   - Show CRM-specific metrics
   - Follow Wave's widget patterns
   - Integrate with Wave's analytics foundation

Provide complete resource implementations with:
- Form schemas following Wave patterns

- Actions and bulk actions
- Page classes and navigation
- Proper integration with existing Wave admin panel

Ensure all resources feel native to the existing Wave admin experience.
